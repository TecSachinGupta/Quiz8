1. Which of the following is true of unsupervised and supervised learning during training of a network? (check all that apply)
 - [x] In supervised learning, inputs are provided to the network
 - [] In unsupervised learning, correct outputs are provided to the network
 - [x] In unsupervised learning, inputs are provided to the network
 - [x] In supervised learning, correct outputs are provided to the network

2. Recall the perceptron, which classifies inputs as belonging to one of two categories, and correspondingly outputs either +1 or -1. Consider a perceptron that receives two inputs u_1u 1​	  and u_2u2​ with synaptic weights 1 and 3 respectively. If the threshold \muμ for the perceptron is 0, which of the following inputs [u_1 u_2][u1​u2​] will lead to a positive output from perceptron? (check all that apply)
- [x] [-1 1]
- [] [1 1]
- [x] [-1 -1]
- [x] [1 -1]

3. Suppose a perceptron receiving 5 inputs is being trained to categorize input patterns \bf uu (a 5-element vector consisting of either +1 or -1 for each of the inputs) into one of two categories. The perceptron generates an output vv (+1 or -1) corresponding to its categorization of the input pattern. Synaptic weights w_iw i​  are given in vector \bf ww. Now suppose that the perceptron has incorrectly classified the most recent input pattern [+1 -1 -1 +1 -1], outputting +1 when it should have given -1. According to the perceptron learning rule, which of the following adjustments should be made? (check all that apply)
- [x] The threshold should increase 
- [x] w_3w3 should decrease
- [] The threshold should decrease
- [] w_3w  should increase
